## Welcome to GitHub Pages

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/eac81c88e89148c4a8139f8868722306)](https://app.codacy.com/app/dennis90001/watts?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=Watemlifts/watts&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Watemlifts/watts/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Watemlifts/watts/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
